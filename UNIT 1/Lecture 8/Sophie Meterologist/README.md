Sophie is a meteorologist, and she needs a program to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. However, she also wants the program to warn her when the entered temperature is outside the human-survivable temperature range. The program should take a temperature in Fahrenheit as input, validate whether it's within the safe range, and convert it to Celsius if it is.



Can you help Sophie develop this simple program?



Formula: celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9

Input format :
The input consists of a double value, representing the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Output format :
If the input temperature is within the safe range (between -100째F and 150째F), print the converted temperature in Celsius (rounded to two decimal places).

If the input temperature is outside the safe range, print "Temperature outside the human-survivable range".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

The safe temperature range is from -100째F to 150째F.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
123.5
Output 1 :
Temperature in Celsius: 50.83 C
Input 2 :
-65.1
Output 2 :
Temperature in Celsius: -53.94 C
Input 3 :
178.46
Output 3 :
Temperature outside the human-survivable range
Input 4 :
-101.0
Output 4 :
Temperature outside the human-survivable range
