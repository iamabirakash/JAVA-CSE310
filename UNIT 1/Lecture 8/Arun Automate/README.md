Arun is working on a project to automate the process of determining whether a student has passed or failed based on their subject marks. 



He aims to create a simple program that takes positive integers as marks for five subjects from the user. If the average of the marks is greater than or equal to 50, the student has passed the exam. Else, the student has failed.



Help Arun to implement the project.

Input format :
The input consists of five space-separated integers, representing the marks in five subjects.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "Average score: " followed by an integer, representing the average score.

If the condition is satisfied the second line of output prints "The student has passed".

Otherwise, the output prints "The student has failed".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ marks ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
50 60 70 80 90
Output 1 :
Average score: 70
The student has passed
Input 2 :
39 25 30 45 67
Output 2 :
Average score: 41
The student has failed
