Shriram is creating a program for a parking lot that calculates the parking fee for vehicles based on the number of hours they have been parked. The fee calculation follows specific rules:



If the vehicle has been parked for less than 2 hours, the fee is Rs.5.0
If the vehicle has been parked for 2 to 4 hours (inclusive), the fee is Rs.8.0
If the vehicle has been parked for more than 4 hours, the fee is Rs.10.0


Help Shriram in developing the program.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer n, representing the number of hours the vehicle has been parked.

Output format :
If the input is a non-negative integer, print the fee amount. "Parking Fee: Rs.<<Fee>>" rounded off to one decimal point.

If the input is negative, "Hours parked cannot be negative."



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
