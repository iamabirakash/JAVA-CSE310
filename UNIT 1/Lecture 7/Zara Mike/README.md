Zara and Mike are comparing their savings to decide their next move. If Zara's savings are greater than Mike's, they plan to calculate the difference; otherwise, they'll add both savings together. She wants to write a program to compute the result of this comparison and multiply it by 2, considering operator precedence.



Help them in the programming task.

Input format :
The input consists of two integers a and b, representing Zara's and Mike's savings.

Output format :
The output prints the calculated result.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
100 250
Output 1 :
Result of (100 > 250 ? 100 - 250 : 100 +250) * 2: 700
Input 2 :
20 15
Output 2 :
Result of (20 > 15 ? 20 - 15 : 20 +15) * 2: 10
