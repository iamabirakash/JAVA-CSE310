Vishal and Arun are discussing the properties of numbers. Vishal gives Arun two integers. He asks Arun to check if the sum of these two numbers is a multiple of their product.



Can you assist Arun and determine whether the sum is a multiple of the product?

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated integers.

Output format :
The output prints:

"Sum is Multiple of Product" if the sum of the two numbers is divisible by their product.
"Sum is Not Multiple of Product" otherwise.


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ input integers ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 2
Output 1 :
Sum is Not Multiple of Product
Input 2 :
2 2
Output 2 :
Sum is Multiple of Product
