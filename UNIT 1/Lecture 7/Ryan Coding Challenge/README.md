Question 1:-
Ryan is working on a coding challenge where he needs to analyze two integers. He wants to determine if both numbers are positive and they are not divisible by 2. If the condition is true, he will print a specific message; otherwise, a different message should be displayed. 



Help Ryan to solve this problem using operators. 

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated integers.

Output format :
If the input numbers are positive and not divisible by 2, print "Both integers are positive and not multiples of 2".

If the condition is not met, print "The condition is not met for both integers".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

-100 ≤ input integers ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4 2
Output 1 :
The condition is not met for both integers
Input 2 :
4 -1
Output 2 :
The condition is not met for both integers
Input 3 :
3 7
Output 3 :
Both integers are positive and not multiples of 2
