Shreya is a student who needs to calculate her exam percentage. Her regular percentage is calculated using the formula (obtained marks / total marks) * 100. However, as a scholarship student, she receives an additional 5% bonus on her calculated percentage. 



Write a program that uses an overridden method calculatePercentage to compute both her regular and scholarship percentages.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, which represents the total marks in the exam.

The second line consists of an integer m, which represents the marks obtained by the student.

Output format :
The first line of output displays a double value, representing the percentage of marks obtained by the regular student, rounded to two decimal places.

The second line displays a double value, representing the percentage of marks obtained by the scholarship student, rounded to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
