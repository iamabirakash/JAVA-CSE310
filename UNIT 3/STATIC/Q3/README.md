You are given a Java program with two classes, SuperClass and SubClass. The SubClass is a subclass of SuperClass. 



The SuperClass has an integer variable variableA, which is initialized by taking input from the user using a Scanner object. The SubClass has an integer variable variableB, which is calculated as twice the value of variableA from the superclass.



Your task is to complete the program by using the super keyword to access the variableA from the superclass SuperClass within the SubClass. Once you complete the program, it should create a SubClass object, calculate the value of variableB using the super keyword, and then display both variableA from the SuperClass and variableB from the SubClass using the displayVariables() method.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer representing the value of variableA.

Output format :
The output displays the values of SuperClass and SubClass in separate lines.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
0 ≤ variableA ≤ 104

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
Output 1 :
The value of SuperClass: 5
The value of SubClass: 10
Input 2 :
18
Output 2 :
The value of SuperClass: 18
The value of SubClass:
