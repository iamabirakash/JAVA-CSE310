Arun is working on a project to convert seconds to a time format. He wants to create a program that accepts a time duration in seconds and converts it into hours, minutes, and seconds. 



Help him write a logic under class SecondsToTime with a constructor that gets input in seconds and converts it into hh:mm:ss format.

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer, representing the time duration in seconds.

Output format :
The output prints the converted time in the format 'hh:mm:ss' where hh represents hours, mm represents minutes, and ss represents seconds.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ Time in Seconds ≤ 106

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3665
Output 1 :
01:01:05
Input 2 :
7200
Output 2 :
02:00:00
Input 3 :
60
Output 3 :
00:01:00
