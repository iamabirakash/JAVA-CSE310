Bob is curious about palindrome numbers and wants a program to check if a given integer is a palindrome. The program should take an integer input, use a class with a parameterized constructor and an initializer block to initialize values, and implement a method to check and display whether the given number is a palindrome or not.



Assist Bob to create the program.

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer representing the input number.

Output format :
The output prints whether the given integer is a palindrome or not.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

11 ≤ input number ≤ 109

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
121
Output 1 :
121 is a Palindrome
Input 2 :
1000
Output 2 :
1000 is not a Palindrome
Input 3 :
123321
Output 3 :
123321 is a Palindrome
