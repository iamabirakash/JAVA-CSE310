Arjun is developing a text search tool to locate specific phrases within a larger text. He wants to write a program that takes a main string and a target substring as input. The program should check if the target substring exists within the main string and display it if found. If the substring is not present, print an appropriate message indicating its absence.



Can you assist Arjun in creating this search tool?

Input format :
The first line of input contains a string representing the main string.

The second line of input contains a string representing the target substring.

Output format :
The output prints the found substring or "Substring not found" if the target substring is not present in the main string.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The strings are case-sensitive.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
The quick brown fox
quick
Output 1 :
Found Substring: quick
Input 2 :
The quick brown fox
the quick
Output 2 :
Substring not found
