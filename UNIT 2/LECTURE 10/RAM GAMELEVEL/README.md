Ram wants to create a program that utilizes an enumeration GameLevel to assign difficulty levels to players based on their scores in a game. The difficulty levels are categorized as EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD.



Your task is to implement a program to help Ram with the following requirements:

Define an enumeration GameLevel with values: EASY, MEDIUM, HARD.
Implement a program that takes a player's score as input and determines their difficulty level using the following criteria:
If the player's score is between 0 and 50 (both inclusive), the difficulty level is EASY.
If the player's score is greater than 50 and up to 75 (inclusive), the difficulty level is MEDIUM.
If the player's score is greater than 75, the difficulty level is HARD.


Help Ram with the implementation.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer S, representing the player's score.

Output format :
The output prints the assigned difficulty level for the player.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
enum type: EASY, MEDIUM, HARD

1 ≤ S ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
45
Output 1 :
EASY
Input 2 :
55
Output 2 :
MEDIUM
Input 3 :
80
Output 3 :
HARD
